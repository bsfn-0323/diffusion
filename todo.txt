[x]  Linear score: check x_recon G(r) in function of reconstruction time in both np.sign and not.
[x]  Use the x^2-1 constraint to get binary variables.
[x]  Determine the exact score using the x**2 -1 constraint
[x]  Implement the exact score with the x**2-1 constraint
[x] Check that the x_recon data behave critically
[x] Check x_recon G(r) using the constrained score
[x] Instead of using a constant diffusing temperature use a T(t) that goes to 0 tor t->0
